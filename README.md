# Image-denoising
This project demonstrates the denosing of cold atom absorption images using PCA based eigen-face recognition techniques.

>The details of the steps are all included in the notebook. While using your own data, be sure to alter the data path in the script.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This code is optimized for absorption images coming from cold atoms. For ultracold BEC, significant changes need to done in the code in the masking section.
